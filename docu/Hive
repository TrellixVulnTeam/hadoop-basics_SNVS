Hive
-uses familiar SQL syntax (HiveQL)
-interactive -- can execute commands line by line
-Scalable - works with big data on a cluster
-most appropriate for data warehouse operations/applications
-Easy OLAP queries
-Highly optimized
-Highly extensible
	-User defined functions
	-Thrift Server
	-JDBC/ODBC driver


Why not Hive?
-High latency - not appropriate for OLTP
-Stores data de-normalized
-SQL is limited to what it can do
	-Pig, Spark allows more complex stuff
-No transactions
-No record-level updates, inserts, deletes


How Hive works
-Hive does Schema on Read
-takes unstructured data and applies schema when reading from it.
-LOAD data from a cluster
	-moves data from a distributed filesystem into Hive
-LOAD data local
	-copies data from your local file system into Hive
