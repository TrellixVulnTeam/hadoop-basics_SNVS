Processing Streams of Data



Spark Streaming
-Big Data never stops!
-analyze data streams in real time, instead of in huge batch jobs daily
-processing of those chunk of data/RDDs can be done in parallel

--DStream(Discretized Steams)
-generates RDDs for each time step and can produce output at each time step
-these DStreams can be processed continuously as long as there is new data coming in or for a given period of time
-they can be processed in the sam eway as RDDs

Common stateless transformations on DStreams
-Map
-Flatmap
-Filter
-reduceByKey

Stateful data
-also maintain a long-loved state on a DStream


Windowing
-allow you to compute results across a longer time period than your batch interval


Batch intervak vs Slide interval vs Windows interval
-batch interval is how often data is captured into a Dstream
-slide interval is how often windowed tranformation is computed
-windows interval is how far back in time the windowed transformation goes



Structured Streaming 
-it uses dataset/dataframes instead of RDDs/DStreams


Adavantages of Structured Streaming
-Streaming code looks a lot like quivalent non-streaming code
-structured data allows Spark to represent data more efficiently






Apache Strom
-another framework for processing continuous streams of data on a cluster
-can run on top of YARN
-main diff from Spark Streaming storm works on individual events not micro-batches
-
-stream.. contains tuples of data which originates from spout
-bolts.. process stream data as it's recieved
-topology.. a graph of spouts and bolts that process your stream




Flink
-another framework for processing continuous streams of data on a cluster
-can run on standalone cluster, or on top of YARN or MESOS
-highly scalable
-fault tolerant
	-can survive failures while still guranteeing exactly-once processing
-Flink can connect to


Fink vs Spark Streaming vs Storm
-Flink faster than Storm
-does "real-time" streaming
-has good Scala support like Spark Streaming
-can process data based on event-time not when data was recieved
	-impressive windowsing system
	-major financial applications
