Overall Eagle View


How the pieces Fit together!
-Core Hadoop Ecosystem.. first 3 things
	-HDFS: big data into blocks replicated across 	       cluster
			-what gets stored where
	
	-YARN: managing the computation and processing of 	       the those data blocks
		   -what gets run where

	-MapReduce: transform and aggregate data across c            cluster using YARN to figure out how to d             distribute that work
				-mapper.. tranform data
				-reducers.. aggregate data



	-Hive: -SQL like language on top of your data across	    allowing SQL like queries to analyze data in HDFS and using YARN and MapReduce to distribute processing of the query

	-Pig: -same as hive
			-scripting interface called PigLatin

	-Tez: alternative to MapReduce
			-use DAG
			-efficient to MapReduce
			-Hive and Pig have alternative for MapReduce which is Tez

	-Spark: -based on Dag
			-not just Api but process itself 
			-very powerful toolkit for analyzing and process data across hadoop cluster

	-HBase: -offer nosql interface following google b        bigtable picture
			-architectured to favour consistency



	External Data Storage
	-MySQL
	-Cassandra: nosql database
				-favour availability all the time
	-mongoDB: similar to HBase
				-more general purpose


	Data Ingestion
	-sqoop: way to import/export data from relational database into cluster at scale using MapReduce


	-Zookeeper: various systems use to keep track of things like who is the current master server

	-oozie: maintains workflows
			-let's you schedule jobs across cluster


	Query Engines
	-hue: cloudera answer to Ambari
			-provide web user interface

	-Zeppelin: notebook for interacting with the data

	-Drill, Phoenix, Presto: 
				-allow to write Sql queries that might span multiple storage or database technologies
	

	Streaming Technologies
	-Apache Storm, Spark Streaming, Flink:
				-processing real time data as they come in


	Streaming data into cluster
	-Kafka, Flume:
			-technologies for streaming data into your cluster at scale
			-move data from one cluster reliably and very high transaction rate 



	Apache Ambari: -allows install and manage services
					-provide web interface for working with some systems
