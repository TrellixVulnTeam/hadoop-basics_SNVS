chapter 1: NOSQL vs relational databases/ key-value databases
chapter 2: document databases


chapter 1:
RElational databases
-uses tables/rows/columns
-need a predefined schema/complicated to change
-slow queries when joining multiple tables
-vertically scalable
	-scale by adding more power -ram, cpu
	-more expensive
-guarantee ACID transactions
-typically closed source



No SQL
-non-relational
-not only sql
-don't use table/rows/columns
-schema less/easy changes
-fast queries
-horizontal scalable/cheaper
	-adding more machines
-most don't support ACID 



-->Types
-key-value databses
	-get/set values with associated keys
	-keys:
		-binary sequences
		-unique
		-can be genrated by algorithms
		-no long keys

	-values:
		-associated with a key
		-retrieve, set, delte a value by key
		-size restrictions

-popular key-value databses
	-reids
	-dynamo DB



Advantages of Key-Value databases
-key-value tuple
-no defined schema/types
-basic operations:
	-put : inserts new key-value
		   updates
	-get : returns the value given by a key
	-delete : removes a key and its value
-fast operations
-flexible: allow changes in data types as opposed to relational databases
-add additional attributes
-information stored in memory:  -fast reads/writes
								-can lose data
-can scale horizontally called Sharding


Limitations
-just search by key
	-problem if we don't know key
	-some can also search by value
	-some can seach by several keys simultaneously
-not complex queries




When to use key-value databses
-storing User sessions
	-key: session id
	-value: info about users
-user profiles and user preferences
-shopping carts
-real-time recommendations
-advertising
-store the infomation as a value in a single object


Unsuitable Cases
-search data by its value
-related data/joins



Redis 
-remote dictionary server
-fast in-memory data structure
-used as 
	-databse
	-cache
	-message broker
-supports Atomic operations
-transactions: execution of group of commands
-python, R, Java, JS
-asynchronous replication
-session storage
-chatting, messaing and queues





Document Database
-store data in documents
-documents grouped into collections
-documents -->row
-collection -->tables
-schemaless
-fomats: JSON, YAML, XMAL, BSON
-keys: strings
-more complex queries than key-value db
-polymorphic: document within the same collection 				dont need to have same structure


Collection
-sets of documents
-store same type of entities


-->Mongo DB, Dynamo DB


Advantages
-flexibility
-don;t need to predefine schemas
-avoids schema migrations
-avoid joins
-JSON is human-readable
-less coding, simple and faster development
-horizontal scalability -sharding


Limitations
-care about redundant data
-care about data in application/ document data


When to use?
-catalogs: e-commerce, different attributes between products --> polymorphism
-event logging
-user profiles
-content managemnet systems
	-user's contents
-real-time analytics


Unsuitable cases
-very structured data--- not best case
-always have consistent data



-->Mongo DB
-document databases
-BSON (Binary JSON) format
-MQL query language
-native drivers for python, java, scala
-index any field
-ACID transcations
-joins in queries
-scale horizontally
-replication
