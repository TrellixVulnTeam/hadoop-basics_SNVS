NOSQL 
-alternative to RDBMS
-NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables
-They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.


-build on top of HDFS
-non-relational, scalabale database built on HDFS
-no query lang but has an api for quick response


CRUD operation with API
-no query language, only CRUD API


web application -->hbase - it doesn't directly talk to HMaster(Master servers) but instead talks with Sharded region servers directly
-HMaster keeps track of the contents of the Region servers and actully schemas of the data
-HMaster depends on Zookeeper(who watches the watchers)
-data itself is stored on BigFiles on HDFS


HBase data model
-fast access to any given ROW
-a ROW is referenced by a unique key
-each Row has some small number of Column Families
-a Column Family may contain arbritrary Columns
-Colummn Families may contain very large number of Columns
-Each Cell can have many Versions with given timestamps
-Sparse data is A.Ok. Sparse cell consume no memory



Ways to access HBase
-HBase shell
-Java Api
	-wrappers for Python, Scala,etc
-Spark, Hive, Pig
-Rest service




CASANDRA - NoSQL with a twist
- no master node at all
- data model similar to BigTable/HBase
- non-relational but has a limited CQL query language as its interface
