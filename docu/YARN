YARN - Yet Another Resource Negotiator

What is YARN?
-separates the problem of managing resources on your cluster from MapReduce
-you don't need to actually write code against YARN yourself in this day and age
-it sits on top of HDFS and below MapReduce, Spark or Tez
-it is the cluster computing resources manager

-Client Node reuquests a job to be executed --> YARN kicks off the Application Master --> Application master then is responsible along with YARN for spinning off more Nodes that excute the original job

-where to run all these appln process, where to spin-off the nodes, how to distribute job across them and optimizing its execution

-you can specify data locality
	-YARN will try to get your process on the same node that has your HDFS

-you can specify different scheduling options for applications
	-FIFO: first in first out
	-Capacity: may run jobs in parallel if there's enough spare capacity
	-Fair Schedulers: may cut into a larger running job if you want to squeeze in a small one
