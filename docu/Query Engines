Query Engines
At a high level, a query engine is a piece of software that sits on top of a database or server and executes queries against data in that database or server to provide answers for users or applications. 
-this provides a single interface to the end users irrespective of the database system used



Apache Drill
-SQL interface on top of Non-Relational Database
-SQL for NoSql
- SQl query engine for a variety of non-relational databases and data files
-even flat JSON or Parquet files on HDFS, S3, Azure
-Real SQL query is used
-SQL for your entire ecosystem
-you can perform joins on tables from different databases like 


Apache Phoenix
-SQL interface on top of Non-Relational Database
-works for only HBase
-Fast, low-latency - OLTP support
-Supports secondary indices and user-defined functions
-Integrates with MapReduce, Spark, Hive, Pig and Flume
-Exposes a JDBC connector for HBase

Why Phoneix?
-really fast
-phoenix can do work of optimizing more complex queries
	-but remember HBase is still fundamentally non-relational
