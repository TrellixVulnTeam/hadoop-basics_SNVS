Scala


Singleton Objects
A singleton is a class that can have only one instance, i.e., Object. You create singleton using the keyword object instead of class keyword.

Private Objects
A private member is visible only inside the class or object that contains the member definition.
example: private def f()

Protected Members
A protected member is only accessible from subclasses of the class in which the member is defined.

Public Members
They can be accessed from anywhere and do not require any keyword for defining them.
